- **Switching via Memory**:
    - **Function**:
        - Earliest form of switching; uses **CPU** to directly control routing.
        - **Input port** sends packet to **CPU memory**, which then forwards it to the output port.
    - **Limitations**:
        - Bandwidth limitation due to memory read/write constraints.
        - **Single packet** transfer at a time (one read/write operation).
        - **Throughput** limited to **B/2**, where B is memory bandwidth.
    - **Modern Application**:
        - Some routers (e.g., Cisco’s Catalyst 8500 series) still use memory-based switching with improvements, like line-card processing.

- **Switching via Bus**:
    - **Process**:
        - Input port tags each packet with an **internal label** indicating the output port.
        - Packets are placed on a **shared bus**; only the target output port picks the packet.
        - **Bus speed** dictates switching rate, with a one-packet-at-a-time limitation.
    - **Suitability**:
        - Works well for **small or local networks** where high throughput isn’t critical.
        - Used in **Cisco 6500 series**, which operates over a 32-Gbps backplane bus.
    - **Limitations**:
        - Limited by the **bus speed**; cannot support high traffic volumes typical of larger networks.

- **Switching via Crossbar Interconnection Network**:
    - **Function**:
        - More advanced, high-capacity switching method.
        - Uses **2N buses** that interconnect **N input and N output ports**.
        - **Crosspoints** at bus intersections allow multiple simultaneous connections.
    - **Benefits**:
        - **Parallel Packet Transfer**: Can handle multiple packets if they target different output ports.
        - **Non-Blocking**: Avoids blocking unless packets from two inputs target the same output port.
    - **Applications**:
        - Ideal for **high-traffic routers** in large-scale networks.
        - Used in **Cisco 12000 series** for extensive throughput.
    - **Advanced Models**:
        - **Multi-Stage Interconnection**: Allows multiple packets to reach the same output port by splitting paths across different stages.
        - Used in **Cisco CRS routers** with a three-stage non-blocking design.
