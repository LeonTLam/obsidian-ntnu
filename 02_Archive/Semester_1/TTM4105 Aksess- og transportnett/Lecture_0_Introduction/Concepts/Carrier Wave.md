# Definition

A **carrier wave, carrier signal** or just **carrier**, is a periodic waveform (usually sinusoidal) that carries no information and has one or more of its properties modified by an information-bearing signal (message signal or modulation signal) for the purpose of conveying information.

# More

The **carrier wave** usually has a much higher freq. than the **message signal** does. This is because it is impractical to transmit signals with low freq.
