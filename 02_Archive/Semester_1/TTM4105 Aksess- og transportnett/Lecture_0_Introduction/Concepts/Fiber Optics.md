# Why use fiber optics?

* Greater bandwidth
* Immunity to crosstalk, no electrical hazard
* Lower loss (0.2 dB/km at 1550nm)
* Does not generate heat
* Long distance communications
* Thinner, lighter than copper or twisted pair
* More flexibility for the future
* Lower total cost of ownership
* Environmentally friendly material - sand

Downsides:
* Complex procedures for splicing and mounting the connectors
* Easy to break

# Optical Fiber Loss

Main cause of loss is **Rayleigh Scattering**, accounts for 96% of the attenuation in the optical fibers.

Caused by interaction of light with silica molecules

# Power Budget

A receiver needs to receive a minimum strength of the signal to able to correctly interpret it.

A receiver does not want to receive a too strong signal, as not to overwhelm/overload the receiver.
Therefore, it is important to calculate the amount of loss that a datalink can tolerate and still operate properly.

The power budget is the available power that can be lost from transmission to the lowest power needed at the receiver to operate at a specific bit error level.

# Principles of the Optical Fibers

Optical fiber is a guided media made up of transparent dielectric materials, through which the light travel along its length, by the rule of total internal reflection.

*Light travels faster in air than in glass.*

The speed of light in a medium is given by the formula:

$$ v = \frac{c}{\micro}$$
$v - \text{speed of light in any medium}$
$c - \text{speed of light in the vacuum}$
$\micro - \text{index o frefraction}$

The refractive index (n) is a measurement of how good the medium transmitting the light.

High refractive index means worse capability.

The refractive index of glass is higher than air, so the speed of light will be slower in glass than in air.
