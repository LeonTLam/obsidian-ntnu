# Flag

> **UiO-Hacking-Arena{Hidden_folder}**

# Prompt

> **Can you find the flag here: [http://r2d2.hackingarena.com:1818](http://r2d2.hackingarena.com:1818/) ?**

# Solution

Inspect the web page and view source code. You can immediately notice a folder which is not so hidden in the system. Enter the URL including the not so hidden folder.

```
	http://r2d2.hackingarena.com:1818/index_files/
```

Only issue here, is that however you look through the files, you will not find anything regarding to a flag.

This is where you go back to the source code and look a bit deeper. At the very bottom of the source code, you can find a "signature" by **~CyberJimmy**.

Enter **~CyberJimmy** into the URL and access a hidden folder. 

**Tilde ("~")**  is used to prefix hidden temporary files when a document is opened in Windows.
