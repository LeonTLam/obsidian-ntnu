# Solution

Attempt to get redirected to Globus' partners by the text form on the web page. Partners can be found on their official website, if first attempt does not work, attempt all other partners.

Trying to get redirected to the partner [**University of the Witwatersrand**](https://www.globus.uio.no/about/team/partners/wits-johannesburg/) gives us a informative web response regarding the page's structure.

Based on previous knowledge, we can tell that index.php is at directory **/var/www/**, so with this new information we change out index.php with **partnerprocess** to enter the folder.
