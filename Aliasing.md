# Definition

In **signal processing**,**aliasing** is the overlapping of frequency components resulting from a sample rate below the [[The Nyquist Theory|Nyquist rate]]. 

This overlap results in distortion or artifacts when the signal is reconstructed from samples which causes the reconstructed signal to differ from the original continuous signal.
