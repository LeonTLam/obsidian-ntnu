# Concept for [[Introduction.md]]

RF is the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the freq. range from around 20 kHz to around 300 GHz

## The Nyquist Theory

A function containing no freq. higher that X Hz is completely determined by sampling at at least 2X Hz

Under-sampling leads to aliasing

## Linear Quantization

Output values $f_2$ divided in $2^n$ equal steps

Mapping of $f_1 \rightarrow f_2$ through rounding

Limitations of the input values

## Filtering

Process of selectively modifying the frequency content of a signal.

Used for signal separation (ch. separation) and signal reparation (noise reduction).

A *cut-off freq.* is the point where a filter begins to attenuate a signal affecting which freq. pass through and which are blocked.
