# Concept for [[Introduction.md]]

Process of encoding information from message source in a way suitable for transmission. Achieved by altering characteristics of a wave.

By superimposing a msg. on to a high freq. signal known as carrier wave, video, voice and other data can be transmitted.

Why modulation is needed?
* Data rate
* Antenna length
* Interference

**Input** signal can be analog or digital -> Analog & Digital modulation

**Baseband signal**, original signal that contains actual information before modulation.
* low-freq. range
* cannot efficiently be transmitted over long distances on most comm. channels.
	* requires large antennas
	* more susceptible to noise and interference

**Carrier signal**, high-freq. sinusoidal waveform used to carry the baseband signal.
