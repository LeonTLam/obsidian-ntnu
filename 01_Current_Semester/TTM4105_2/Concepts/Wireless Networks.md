# Main Challenges

## Attenuation or Signal loss
* Farther signal travels, more strength lost

## Medium is always shared
* Requires mechanisms to coordinate medium access

## Security
* Broadcasting nature of wireless transmission makes the transmitted information vulnerable

## Resource and spectrum utilization
* Spectrum suitable for wireless comm. is becoming increasingly scarce, motivating exploration of new spectrum bands.
