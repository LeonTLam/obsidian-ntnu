# Concept for [[Introduction.md]]

# Signal
*An electrical or electromagnetic quantity (current, voltage, radio wave. micro wave) carries data or information from one system to another.*

# Analog
Signal intensity varies in a smooth fashion over time
No breaks or discontinuities in the signal, continuous function of time

# Digital Signal
Signal intensity maintains a constant level for some period of time and then changes to another constant level

# Periodic Signal

*Analog or digital signal pattern that repeats over time*

$$\begin{aligned}
s(t+T)=s(t)\\
-\infty < t < +\infty
\end{aligned}$$
where T is the period of the signal

# Sine Wave Parameters

$$\begin{aligned}
s = A\sin(2\pi ft+\phi)
\\
f -\text{frequency}\\
t -\text{given time}\\
A -\text{amplitude}\\
\phi -\text{phase shift}
\end{aligned}$$
Phase is a measure of the relative position in time within a single period of a signal
