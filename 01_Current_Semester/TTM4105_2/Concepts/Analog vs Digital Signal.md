# Concept for [[Introduction.md]]

# Signal
*An electrical or electromagnetic quantity (current, voltage, radio wave. micro wave) carries data or information from one system to another.*

# Analog
Signal intensity varies in a smooth fashion over time
No breaks or discontinuities in the signal, continuous function of time

# Digital Signal
Signal intensity maintains a constant level for some period of time and then changes to another constant level

# Periodic Signal

*Analog or digital signal pattern that repeats over time*
