## Factorisation

$Z = \text{set of integers}$

For $a$ and $b$ in $Z$, we say that $a$ divides $b$ if there exists $k$ in $Z$, such that $a*k = b$

``` Example
Let a = 4 and b = 20
4 divides 20 ( 4|20 ) if there is an integer k such that:

4 * k = 20

If k = 5, then:

4 * 5 = 20

Therefor 4 divides 20, or 4|20
```


If $a$ divides $b$ and $a$ divides $c$, then $a$ divides $b + c$

``` Example

Let a=3, b=12, and c=15

3 divides 12 ( 3∣12 ) if there is an integer k1​ such that:  
3 * k1 = 12

If k1 = 4, then:  
3 * 4 = 12

3 divides 15 ( 3∣15 ) if there is an integer k2​ such that:  
3 * 2 = 15

If k2 = 5, then:  
3 * 5 = 15

Now consider b + c = 12 + 15 = 27

Check if 3 divides 27 ( 3∣27 ):  
Is there an integer k3​ such that 3 * k3 = 27 ?

If k3 = 9, then:  
3 * 9 = 27

Therefore, 3∣27, so:  
If a∣b and a∣c, then a∣(b+c)
```
