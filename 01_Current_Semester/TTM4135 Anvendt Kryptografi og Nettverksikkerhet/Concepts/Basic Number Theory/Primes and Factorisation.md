## Factorisation

$Z = \text{set of integers}$

For $a$ and $b$ in $Z$, we say that $a$ divides $b$ if there exists $k$ in $Z$, such that $a*k = b$

``` Example
Let a = 4 and b = 20
4 divides 20 ( 4|20 ) if there is an integer k such that:

4 * k = 20

If k = 5, then:

4 * 5 = 20

Therefor 4 divides 20, or 4|20
```
