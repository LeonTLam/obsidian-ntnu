A **field** is a set $F$ with two binary operations $+ \text{ and } \cdot$, satisfying following conditions:

For secure communications we are usually only interested in fields with a finite number of elements.

A famous theorem says that finite fields exist of size $p^n$ for any prime $p$ and positive integer $n$, and that no finite field exists of other sizes.

The most interesting cases for us are fields of size $p$ for a prime $p$ and fields of size $2^n$ for some integer $n$.
