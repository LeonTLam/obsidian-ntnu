## Definition "Abelian group"

*a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written*

### Example

Check if ($Z$, $+$) forms a group:
$Z = \{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\}$

**Closure:**
Add any two integers, you get another integer
$$3+-5 = -2 \in Z\text{ or }-5+3=-2\in Z$$
**Identity:**
Identity element is $0$, because
$$a+0=0+a=$$
