## Alphabets

Historical ciphers has required a defined alphabet for both plaintext and ciphertext (usually the same).

Roman alphabet: A, B, C, ..., Z. Sometimes including space, and sometimes both upper and lower case, and sometimes punctuation.
For some ciphers, we map the alphabet to numbers: A=0, B=1, C=2,...,Z=25. If space is included, we map it to 26.

## Statistical attacks

Statistical attacks depend on using the redundancy of the plaintext.
In written text, considerable information is available from the distribution of single letters, digrams and trigrams to help in the attack.
The exact statistics of a language will vary according to what sample is taken.
