*The study of designing cryptosystems.*

# Cryptanalysis
*The study of breaking cryptosystems*

# Confidentiality and Authentication
Cryptography, transformation of data depending on secret called **key**.

Used to provide confidentiality and authentication (or integrity).

**Confidentiality** - key needed to **read** message.
**Authentication** - key needed to **write** message.

# Cryptosystems

Consists of:
* set of plaintexts (original message)
* set og ciphertexts (encrypted message)
* set of keys
* function transforming plaintext to ciphertext (encryption)
* inverse function transforming ciphertext to plaintext (decryption)
