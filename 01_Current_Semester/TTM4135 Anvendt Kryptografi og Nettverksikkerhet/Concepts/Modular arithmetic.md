$b$ is a residue of $a$ modulo $n$ if $a-b=kn$ for some integer $k$.
$$a\equiv b (\bmod n) <=> a-b=kn$$
## Residue class

A **complete set of residues modulo n** is a set on $n$ integers where every integer is congruendt mod $n$ to exactly one of those numbers.

*For any integer $a$, there ins one nad only one number inthe set *
