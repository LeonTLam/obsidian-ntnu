# Concept for [[Hill cipher, Stream Ciphers and One-time Pad.md]]

Fun use of OTP, visual cryptography, splitting image into key and ciphertext.

Decryption performed by overlaying to shared images.

Simplest case of monochrome images (black and white pixels).

Each image revealing no information about the image.
