# Concept for [[Hill cipher, Stream Ciphers and One-time Pad.md]]

Truly random sequence of characters, all of them independently generated.

Key used only once.

Alphabet can be of any length, usually either natural language alphabet or binary alphabet (0,1).

Binary alphabet one-time pad is a (non-periodic) binary synchronous stream cipher.

Provides **perfect secrecy** when requirements are met:
* Key is truly random
* Used only once
* Kept secret
