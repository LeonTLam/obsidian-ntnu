## Basic Cipher Operations
Most historical ciphers are based on a combin. of two basic operations:

**Transposition:** characters in plaintext are mixed up with each other (permuted).
**Substitution:** Each character (or set of char.) is replaced by a different character (or set of char.).

### Transposition ciphers
permutes characters usually in fixed period $d$ and permutation $f$.

Consider the plaintext as a matrix of rows of length $d$.

Generally transposition ciphers can permute rows or columns and output in row or column order.
