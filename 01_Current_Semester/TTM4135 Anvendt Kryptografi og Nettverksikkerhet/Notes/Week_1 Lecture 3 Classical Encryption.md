## Key Points

# Introduction

* Cryptography - *the study of designing cryptosystems*
* Cryptanalysis - *the study of breaking cryptosystems*
Both studied together in practice

## Confidentiality and Authentication

* Cryptography - *secret writing*, transformation of data depending on secret called **key**
	* Can be used to provide *confidentiality* and to provide *authentication (or integrity)*
	* When used for conf., a key is required to read.
	* When used for auth., a key required to write

## Cryptosystems

A cryptosystem consists of:
* Set of plaintexts (original message)
* Set of ciphertexts (encrypted message)
* Set of keys 
* function to transform plaintext into ciphertext 
* Inverse to transform ciphertext to plaintext (decryption)

## Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography 

* Symmetric Key Cipher (secret key cipher)
	* Encryption and decryption keys known only to sender and receiver
	* Requires secure channel for transmission of the cryptographic key
* Asymmetric Key Cipher (public key cipher)
	* Each participant has a public key and a private key
	* May allow for both encryption and creation of digital signatures
	* Public key ciphers will be studied later
