# Prompt

> Hello this is LovelyGiant, are you still in Canada? Since your encrypted messaging app got taken down, I had to contact you here. But to be sure it is the real you, answer this: what is the name of your rottweiler dog?

# Solution

Quick google search of **encrypted messaging app lovelygiant** gave me an article from **Liverpool Echo** where an app is used by a criminal called "LovelyGiant".

The app is called *Encrochat*, and I proceeded by searching **Encrochat Ceo** and found **Paul Krusky**.

Lastly, I searched **Paul Krusky dog** and got a few articles with "Link text" naming the dog **Maggie**.

# Alternative Info

Alternative to reading the "Link Text" would be to use **WayBackMachine** to bypass the paywall for the article and finding it through the text itself.
