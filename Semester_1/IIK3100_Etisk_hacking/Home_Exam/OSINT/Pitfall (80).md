Using OSINT techniques, to research the identity of "王林" (Wang Lin) and his subordinate "董婷" (Dong Ting) by cross-referencing information available through FBI's official website https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/dong-ting

"Magnificent" from the prompt heavily resembles Dong Ting's alias "Maggie". Additional remarks regarding Wang Lin tells us he often travels to Europe where "Oslo, Location Z" resides (from prompt). The only other person who travels to Europe would be Dong Ting.

Flag is therefor Dong Ting's Chinese name.
