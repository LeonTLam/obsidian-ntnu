# Prompt

> Have you solved the "I will rock you" challenge? Can you find me the phone number of W. Axl Rose? I think there are many fake numbers on the Internet (manager, record label, etc), but I'm looking for the one that is registered in the US Social security system.

# Solution

Google about breaches or leaks of social security numbers, where news hint that it has been confirmed.

Look further for methods or ways to check if data is breached in the NPD breach. Use website npd.pentester.com and fill out the form

"fake email", "Axl", "Rose", "California", 1962

Where the state he lives in is found on the internet from when he bought a $4.2 million mansion in Malibu, and the birth year from Wikipedia.

npd.pentester.com will confirm that the data has been breached and provide the phone number and more information.
