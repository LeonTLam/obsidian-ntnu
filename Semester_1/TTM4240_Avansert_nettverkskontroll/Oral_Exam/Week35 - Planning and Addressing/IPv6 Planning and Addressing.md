# Introduction

An IPv6 address is 128 bits long, in theory there are $2^{128}$ addresses available, contra IPv4 with $2^32$ (= 4.3b).

IPv4 planning requires the network managers to be efficient with the available addresses. If you where to apply for an IPv6 address range, most ISP's will provide a /48 prefix (2)
