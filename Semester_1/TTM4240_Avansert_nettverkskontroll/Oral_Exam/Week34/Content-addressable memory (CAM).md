# What CAMs are
 * Hardware search engines
 * Much faster than algorithmic approaches
 * Composed of conventional semiconductor memory (usually SRAM)
 * Mostly used for search-intensive tasks - packet forwarding and packet classification in Internet routers

Routers forwarding incoming packets by using a address lookup function. Examine packet's destination address and chooses accordingly which outport port to send the packet.

The router's list of destination addresses and corresponding outport is called a routing table.
