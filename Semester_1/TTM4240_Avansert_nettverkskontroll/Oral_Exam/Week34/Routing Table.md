# What is a Routing Table?
A routing table is often viewed in table format, used to determine where data packets will be directed through an Internet Protocol network. Table is usually stored inside the [[Random Access Memory (RAM)]] of forwarding devices, such as routers and network switches.

The routing table stores source and destination IP addresses in from of prefixes along with default gateway addresses and corresponding routing information.

Routing tables are typically updated dynamically through network routing protocols, but can be added manually as static entries.

Routing parameters that determine complexity are entry size, table size, search rate and table update rate.
