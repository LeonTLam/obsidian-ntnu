**Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**: is used to exchange reachability information in the Internet.

When a pair of **ASes** agree to use **BGP** to exchange routing information, each AS must designate a router that will speak BGP on its behalf. These pair of routers are known as **BGP peers** of one another.
