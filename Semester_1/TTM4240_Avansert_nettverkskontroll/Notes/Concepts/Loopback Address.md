* **Testing Network Connectivity** Guarantees the functionality of the community stack on a tool. By sending information to the LO, they can verify whether or not the device's community additives are operational
* **Troubleshooting Network Issues:** Serves as a diagnostic device for separating network issues. Can be used to distinguish whether network troubles from the tool itself or outside factors.
* **Local development and testing:** Can be used to test neighborhood development and networked applications. Used to simulate community conversation inside the device, without the need of external servers or internet connectivity.

*Loopback Interface?*
Allows user to *ping* or self-reference, a device by sending its data packets back to itself.
