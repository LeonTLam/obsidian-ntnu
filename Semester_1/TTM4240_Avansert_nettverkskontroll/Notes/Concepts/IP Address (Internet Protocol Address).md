Network address for a source/destination.

How an IP address works in a web-surfing scenario:
* A device directly requests the Service Provider which then grants the device access to the web.
* An IP Address is assigned to the device from the given range available.
* The internet activity goes through your service provider, and THEY route it back to you, using your IP address.
* If the router for the devices is turned off and reset, the IP address can change.
* When the device leaves the router, the IP address to the device changes as it changes when switching networks.

**Two types of IP Address**

1. *IPv4:* Internet Protocol version 4. Consists of 4 numbers separated by dots. Each number ranging from 0-255 in decimal numbers.
