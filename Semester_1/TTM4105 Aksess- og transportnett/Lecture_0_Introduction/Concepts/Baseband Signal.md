# Definition

**Baseband** is the range of frequencies occupied by a signal that has not been modulated to higher frequencies. 

See [[Carrier Wave]]

*A baseband signal or lowpass signal is a signal that can include frequencies that are very near zero.*

# Example

The electronic output of a microphone is a baseband signal that is analogous.

# Baseband Channel

A **baseband channel** or **lowpass channel** is a communication channel that can transfer frequencies that are very near zero. Examples are serial cables and local area networks, as opposed to passband channels such as radio frequency channels and passband filtered wires of the analog telephone network.
