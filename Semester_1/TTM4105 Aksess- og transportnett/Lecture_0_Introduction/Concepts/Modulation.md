# Definition

Process of encoding information from a message source in a way that is suitable for transmission. Achieved by altering the characteristics of a wave.

By superimposing a message on to a high frequency signal known as a [[carrier wave]], video, voice and other data can be transmitted.

# Use-case

* Data transfer
* Antenna length
* Interference

Input signal can be analog or digital -> Analog and Digital modulation

Baseband signal and carrier signal

In the modulation process, a parameter of the carrier wave (such as amplitude, frequency or phase) is varied in accordance with the modulating signal.
