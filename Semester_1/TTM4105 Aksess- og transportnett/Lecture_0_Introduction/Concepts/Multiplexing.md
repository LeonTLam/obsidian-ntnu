# Definition

Multiplexing is the method of carrying multiple signals on a shared medium.
- "Mux" them together at sender and "demux" them apart on receivers end
- More efficient use of transmission medium
- Sharing the medium with minimum or no interference

There are 5 dimensions to multiplexing:
* Time
* Frequency
* Code
* Space
* Polarization

# Time Division Multiplexing

```Short
A channel gets the whole spectrum for a short time
```

# Frequency Division Multiplexing

```Short
The spectrum is divided into smaller bands
```

# Types of Communication Link Sharing
