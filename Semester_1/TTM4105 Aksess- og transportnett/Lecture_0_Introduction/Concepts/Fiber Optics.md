# Why use fiber optics?

* Greater bandwidth
* Immunity to crosstalk, no electrical hazard
* Lower loss (0.2 dB/km at 1550nm)
* Does not generate heat
* Long distance communications
* Thinner, lighter than copper or twisted pair
* More flexibility for the future
* Lower total cost of ownership
* Environmentally friendly material - sand

Downsides:
* Complex procedures for splicing and mounting the connectors
* Easy to break

# Optical Fiber Loss

Main cause of loss is **Rayleigh Scattering**, accounts for 96% of the attenuation in the optical fibers.

Caused by interaction of light with silica molecules

# Power Budget

A receiver needs to receive a minimum strength of the signal to able to correctly interpret it.

A receiver does not want to receive a too s
