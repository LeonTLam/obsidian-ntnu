# Definition

**Access networks** are the communication networks that connect [[End-User Devices]] to a [[Wide Area Network (WAN)]].

# Topics

* Radio as communication medium
* Frequency band, [[Modulation]], Multiplexing, Antennas, Coverage, Propagation ...
* Approaches to address the wireless channel impairments 
* Medium Access Control  
* Wireless Local Area Network & Wireless Personal Networks 
* Cellular networks 
* Fixed communication medium (characteristics, availability) 
* Fiber based access and its applications, active/passive FTTH 
* Optical network components

# Basic Concepts

**Home access**: DSL, Cable, FTTH (Fiber to the Home
**Enterprise access**: Ethernet
**Enterprise and Home access**: WiFI
**Wide-area wireless access**: 4G, 5G

## Main Challenges in Wireless Networks

* Attenuation or Signal Loss
	* The farther the signal travels, the more they lose their strength
* Shared medium
	* Requires mechanism to coordinate medium access
* Security
	* Transmitted information is vulnerable
* Resource and spectrum utilization
	* Spectrum for wireless communications is becoming increasingly scarce, motivates the exploration of new spectrum bands

## What is a signal?

*An electrical or electromagnetic quantity (current, voltage, radio wave, micro wave, etc.) that carries data or information form one system to another*

# Radio Frequency

**Radio frequency (RF)** is the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the freq. range from around 20 kHz to around 300 GHz
