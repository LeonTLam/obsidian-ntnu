# Space Division Multiplexing (SDM)

* Assigns space to each comm. channel
* Guard spaces separate interference range
* Allows for reuse of same freq. at same time
* I.E. Analog TV & Radio

* SDM is implemented in cellular system with each **cell** covering a certain area.

* SDM allows **frequency reuse** if two transmitters are far enough from each other

# Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)

* Spectrum is divided into **smaller bands**
* Each communication channel is assigned a band
	* Does not require complex coordination
* Carrier freq. separated so signals do not overlap (**guard bands**)
* I.E. Analog TV/Radio, fiber optics (WDM)

## FDM - Disadvantages

* Inflexible
	* Some channels might need more Bandwidth than others
* Waste of BW if traffic not evenly distributed
	* Burty
