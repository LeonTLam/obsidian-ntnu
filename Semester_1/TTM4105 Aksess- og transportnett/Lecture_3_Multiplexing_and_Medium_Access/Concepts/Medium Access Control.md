Allow multiple users to use the shared medium with minimum to no interference

* Legacy MAC scheme is **CSMA/CD** - Listen before talk
	* Only transmit if medium is idle
	* If collision, sender is able to detect
* Problems with detection in wireless networks
	* Signal strength decreases and it becomes hard to detect collisions
