Errors must be detected and corrected in order to have a reliable communication

**3 common error detection techniques**:
* Parity Check
* Checksum
* Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

# Parity Checks

* Parity bit(s) generated for even number of specific bit

* Checking function at receiver accepts or rejects if total number of specific bit is an even number.
