*Adapting the modulation, coding and other signal parameters to the conditions on the radio link*

* Process is dynamic, requires some channel state information at the transmitter (**monitoring and measuring**)
* Transmitter and receiver **coordinate changes**

The goal of AMC is efficient utilization of resources through:
* Enhanced throughput
* Ability for systems to overcome fading and interference

In case of a **good-quality** channel, we choose modulation and coding combination that gives a high throughput

When conditions change, sender switches to a different modulation-coding combination.
