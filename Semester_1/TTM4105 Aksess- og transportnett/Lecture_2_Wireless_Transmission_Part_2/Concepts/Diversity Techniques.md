Diversity techniques are used to **improve the system performance over a fading channel**

Idea is to send **multiple copies of the same signal with different characteristics**:
* Frequency Diversity - signal carried on multiple frequency carriers
* Time diversity - spreading the data out over time (using different time slots)
* Space diversity - using multiple antennas.

# Multiple Input Multiple Output Atennas (MIMO)

* Multiple antennas at transmitter an receiver (antenna array)
* Allows to send and receive more than one signal on different transmit and receive antennas
* Increased **data rates** without additional transmit power or bandwidth
* Examples, IEEE 802.11n, LTE, ...

# MIMO - Functions

**Spatial diversity**: Send or receive redundant streams of information in parallel along multiple spatial paths
* Increased reliability (unlikely that ALL paths will be degraded simultaneously)
Reduces signal fading by sending multiple copies of the same radio signal, through multiple antennas.

**Spatial multiplexing**: Split high-rate signal into multiple lower rate streams and transmit over different antennas
* Multiplying the data rate by number of used antennas
* Advanced signal processing techniques at the receiver
Boosts data rates by sending the data payload in separate streams through spatially separated antennas.

**Beamforming**: Emit same signal from all antennas focused in the direction of the receiver, to maximize signal power at receiver antenna.
