Diversity techniques are used to **improve the system performance over a fading channel**

Idea is to send **multiple copies of the same signal with different characteristics**:
* Frequency Diversity - signal carried on multiple frequency carriers
* Time diversity - spreading the data out over time (using different time slots)
* Space diversity - using multiple antennas.
