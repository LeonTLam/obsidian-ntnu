# Definition

*An electrical or electromagnetic quantity (current, voltage, radio wave, micro wave, etc.) that carries data or information form one system to another*

# Analog signal

Where signal intensity varies smoothly over time. No breaks or discontinuities in the signal, continuous function of time.

# Digital signal

Where signal intensity maintains a constant level for some period of time, then changes to another constant level. Discrete function of time

# Periodic Signal

Analog or digital signal pattern that repeats over time, where T is the period of the signal:

$$s(t+t)=s(t)$$

# Sine Wave Parameters

$$s=A\times\sin(2\pi f t + \phi)$$
$f - \text{frequency}$
$t - \text{given time}$
$A - \text{amplitude}$
$\phi - \text{phase shift}$

Phase is a measure of the relative position in time within a single period of a signal.
