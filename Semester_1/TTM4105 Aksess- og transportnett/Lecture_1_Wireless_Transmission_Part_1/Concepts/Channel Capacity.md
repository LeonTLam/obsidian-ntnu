*Maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over a given communication path, or channel, under given conditions.*

*Data rate can be achieved is limited by impairments such as noise!*

# Concepts related to channel capacity

**Data rate** - rate at which data can be communicated (bps)

**Bandwidth** (Hertz) 
$$B = f_{high} - f_{low}$$
