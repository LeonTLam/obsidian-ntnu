# Definition

Electromagnetic signal that propagates through a medium

# Three Main Usages

* Transfer information
	* sound and images
	* data transmission: WiFi, Cellular, satellite/GPS
* Sensing/detecting objects
	* Radar and body scanners
* Heating objects
	* Microwave

# About RF Frequencies

When we lower the frequency the RF propagates longer distances and has a higher object penetration.

Broadcast AM and FM uses **medium frequency (MF - 300 kHz to 3000 kHz)** to allow the signal to travel long distances and penetrate buildings.

WiFi uses frequency of 2.4/5 GHz (ca. 25 to 50x higher than AM)

The frequency of an RF is chosen based on the application.

# Spectrum

A range of frequencies.

Not humanly perceivable, therefore spectrum analysers are used to analyse spectrum.

A spectrum analyser detects the kind of signal (power, modulation are present at WHAT frequencies).
