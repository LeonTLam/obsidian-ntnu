# Definition

Electromagnetic signal that propagates through a medium

# Three Main Usages

* Transfer information
	* sound and images
	* data transmission: WiFi, Cellular, satellite/GPS
* Sensing/detecting objects
	* Radar and body scanners
* Heating objects
	* Microwave

# About RF Frequencies

When we lower the frequency the RF propagates longer distances and has a higher object penetration.

Broadcast AM and FM uses **medium frequency (MF - 300 kHz to 3000 kHz)** to allow the signal to travel long distances and penetrate buildings.

WiFi uses frequency of 2.4/5 GHz (ca. 25 to 50x higher than AM)

The frequency of an RF is chosen based on the application.

# Spectrum

A range of frequencies.

Not humanly perceivable, therefore spectrum analysers are used to analyse spectrum.

A spectrum analyser detects the kind of signal (power, modulation are present at WHAT frequencies).

# Frequencies For Radio Transmission

* Low Frequency  (LF - Submarines):
	* Can penetrate water, follows earth's surface, propagate long distances
* Middle and High Frequency (AM and FM radio):
	* Enabled by reflection at the ionosphere
	* Transmit power up to 500kW
* VeryHF and UltraHF (analog/digital tv, DAB, GSM)
	* Small antennas, low transmit power
* SHP (Directed microwave and fixed saatellite)
	* Small antennas and large bandwidth available
* EHF (infra red and direct transmission)
	* very short wavelength and transmission distance.

# Bands

*Specific ranges of frequencies in which signals are used for a specific purpose.*

```Example
AM broadcast band (500 - 1700 KHz) and,
FM broadcast band (88 - 108 MHz)
```

**Unlicensed** bands:
* Known as industrial, Scientific, and Medical bands (ISM)
* Used for WLANs, WPANs, IoT,...
