# Modulation

Digital signals cannot be directly transmitted in the radio medium

**Digital Modulation**: Translate digital signals into (baseband) analog signals - Also known as shift keying
* Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
* Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
* Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
* Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)

**Analog Modulation**: Shift the analog signals into passband signals

## Why do we need Modulation?

1. To generate a modulated signal suited and compatible to the characteristics of the transmission channel
	1. Shift information signal to the carrier frequency
	*Information signal modulates (changes) the carrier signal*
2.
