# Three types of wave Propagation

**Ground wave propagation (below 2 MHz)**
* Follows contour of the earth
* Can propagate considerable distances

**Sky wave propagation (2 to 30 MHz)**
* Reflects from ionized layer of atmosphere (ionosphere)
* Can travel a number of hops between ionosphere and earth's surface

**Line-of-sight (LOS) propagation (above 30 MHz)**
* Propagates wave directly to receiver within Line-of-sight
* Mobile phones uses a modified version of transmission
	* Through diffraction, multipath reflection, local repeaters and rapid handoff

# Signal propagation ranges

* Transmission range 
	* Communication is possible
	* Low error rate

* Detection range
	* Communication not possible, but signal can be detected

* Interference range
	* Signal not detected
	*
