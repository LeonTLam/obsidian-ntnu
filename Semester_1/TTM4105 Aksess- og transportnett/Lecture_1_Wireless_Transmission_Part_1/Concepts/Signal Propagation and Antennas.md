# Three types of wave Propagation

**Ground wave propagation (below 2 MHz)**
* Follows contour of the earth
* Can propagate considerable distances

**Sky wave propagation (2 to 30 MHz)**
* Reflects from ionized layer of atmosphere (ionosphere)
* Can travel a number of hops between ionosphere and earth's surface

**Line-of-sight (LOS) propagation (above 30 MHz)**
* Propagates wave directly to receiver within Line-of-sight
* Mobile phones uses a modified version of transmission
	* Through diffraction, multipath reflection, local repeaters and rapid handoff

# Signal propagation ranges

* Transmission range 
	* Communication is possible
	* Low error rate

* Detection range
	* Communication not possible, but signal can be detected

* Interference range
	* Signal not detected
	* Signal adds to background noise.

# Antennas

*An antenna is an electrical conductor or system of conductors*
* Transmission - radiates electromagnetic energy into space 
* Reception - collects electromagnetic energy from space

* In two-way communication, the same antenna be used for transmission and reception

* Isotropic radiator: equal radiation in all directions
	* Is a theoretical reference to an antenna (not possible in practice)

## Antenna examples - Dipoles

**REAL antennas are NOT isotropic radiators

Used for both transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves.

The same physical structure supports both transmission and reception.

**The total length of the dipole is typically half the wavelength of the signal it is designed to transmit or receive.**

$$L = \frac{\lambda}{2}$$
```Example
If the wavelength is 3 meters, the dipole antenna should be 1.5 meters long
