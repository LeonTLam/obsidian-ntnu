* Noise
	*Unwanted external signal that can impair original signal*

* Transmission Loss
	Mainly by signal attenuation (weakening of signal's strength due to noise, distance or other external factors)

* Multipath
	Caused by reflection, diffraction and scattering

* Doppler spread
	Signal distortion that is caused by the movement of mobile unit

# Attenuation

* Strength of signal falls off with distance
	* Receiving power proportional to 1/d^2 in vacuum
	* Greater at higher frequencies (Greater loss at higher frequencies)

* Received signal:
	* Must have sufficient strength so that the receiver can interpret the signal
	* Must maintain a level sufficiently higher than noise to be received without error

# Free Space Loss - Ideal Isotropic Antenna

**Free Space Loss**l, ideal isotropic antenna through the following formula:

$$\frac{P_t}{P_r}=\frac{(4\pi d)^2}{\lambda ^2}=\frac{(4\pi f d)^2}{c^2}$$
* P_t = Signal power at transmitting antenna
* P_r = Signal power at receiving antenna
* lamda = carrier wavelength
* d = propagation distance between antennas
* c = speed of light (3 * 10^8 m/s)

**In dB**: 
$$L_{dB}= 10\log \frac{P_t}{P_r}$$
