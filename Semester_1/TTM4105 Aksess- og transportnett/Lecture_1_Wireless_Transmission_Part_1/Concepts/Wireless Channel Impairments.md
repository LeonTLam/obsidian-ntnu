* Noise
	*Unwanted external signal that can impair original signal*

* Transmission Loss
	Mainly by signal attenuation (weakening of signal's strength due to noise, distance or other external factors)

* Multipath
	Caused by reflection, diffraction and scattering

* Doppler spread
	Signal distortion that is caused by the movement of mobile unit

# Attenuation

* Strength of signal falls off with distance
	* Receiving power proportional to 1/d^2 in vacuum
